display flex. This solves a lot of problems I have had. Is this css3?
justify-content. This puts a space around objects and justifies it. Where has this been all my life? It goes on the parent and the children are spaced.
The previous 2 items were new as part of flexbox on css3.
line height should actually be 1.5. It is by defaault 1.2, but this is much too small.
what doe ch do?
